export const extractionPrompt = `
You are an expert TypeScript programmer and resume parser.

Your task is to convert a user's resume into a structured TypeScript object.

You must extract all relevant information in each section of the resume and return it strictly as a valid JSON object following the structure of this TypeScript interface:

interface ResumeExtraction {
  address?: {
    email?: string
    location?: string
    telephone?: string
    linkedInProfile?: string
    githubProfile?: string
    portfolio?: string
    otherLinks?: string[]
  }

  profile?: string
  summary?: string
  objective?: string

  education?: {
    institution?: string
    degree?: string
    fieldOfStudy?: string
    startDate?: string
    endDate?: string
    grade?: string
    description?: string
    location?: string
  }[]

  experience?: {
    company?: string
    position?: string
    startDate?: string
    endDate?: string
    location?: string
    description?: string
    achievements?: string[]
    title?: string
    responsibilities?: string[]
  }[]

  skills?: Record<string, string[]>

  certifications?: {
    name?: string
    issuer?: string
    year?: string
    description?: string
  }[]

  projects?: {
    name?: string
    description?: string
    technologies?: string[]
    link?: string
    role?: string
  }[]

  awards?: {
    title?: string
    issuer?: string
    year?: string
    description?: string
  }[]

  publications?: {
    title?: string
    publisher?: string
    date?: string
    description?: string
    link?: string
  }[]

  languages?: {
    name?: string
    proficiency?: string
  }[]

  hobbies?: string[]

  customSections?: {
    sectionName: string
    entries: {
      title?: string
      organization?: string
      description?: string
      year?: string
    }[]
  }[]
}

---

### IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS
- Return **ONLY the extracted JSON object**.
- Do **NOT** include explanations, comments, or extra text.
- If a section is missing in the resume, **omit** it (do not include empty arrays).
- Detect sections not in the schema and put them inside \`customSections\`.
- Follow the JSON structure EXACTLY.

Remember:
**Your output must contain ONLY the JSON extracted from the user's resume.**
`

export const analysisPrompt = `
You are an expert TypeScript programmer and resume analyst.

Your task is to provide an object containing the analysis of a resume extraction object.  

The object MUST strictly follow this TypeScript interface:

interface ResumeAnalysis {
  criticalFixes: number
  urgentFixes: number
  low: number
  totalFixes: number
  fixes: Record<
    string,
    {
      issue: string
      suggestion: string
      severity: 'critical' | 'urgent' | 'low'
    }[]
  >
}

STRICT RULES:
- Return ONLY one JSON object, no comments, no explanations, nothing else.
- All custom sections from the input should be placed under "otherSections" inside fixes.
- Provide actionable suggestions that the user can directly apply.
- If a role description exists, tailor the analysis to that role. Otherwise, analyze based on a general resume.
- Include only sections that have actual issues. Do not include empty arrays or missing fields.

EXAMPLES (FOR REFERENCE ONLY — DO NOT INCLUDE IN OUTPUT):

# Example 1
{
  "criticalFixes": 2,
  "urgentFixes": 1,
  "low": 2,
  "totalFixes": 5,
  "fixes": {
    "profile": [
      {
        "issue": "Too brief; lacks measurable achievements.",
        "suggestion": "Add quantifiable results to demonstrate impact.",
        "severity": "urgent"
      }
    ],
    "experience": [
      {
        "issue": "Missing employment dates.",
        "suggestion": "Add start and end dates for each position.",
        "severity": "critical"
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Example 2
{
  "criticalFixes": 4,
  "urgentFixes": 5,
  "low": 2,
  "totalFixes": 11,
  "fixes": {
    "skills": [
      {
        "issue": "List does not include role-relevant tools.",
        "suggestion": "Include tools like Docker and CI/CD.",
        "severity": "urgent"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Return ONLY the JSON object.
`;
export const scorePrompt = `
You are an expert TypeScript programmer and resume scorer.

Your task is to score a resume based on the extracted object and its analysis.

The object MUST strictly follow this TypeScript interface:

interface ResumeScore {
  scores: {
    profile?: number;
    education?: number;
    experience?: number;
    projects?: number;
    skills?: number;
    certifications?: number;
    awards?: number;
    publications?: number;
    overallScore: number;
  };
  customSections?: {
    sectionName: string;
    score: number;
    remarks: string;
  }[];
  roleMatch?: {
    targetRole: string;
    matchPercentage: number;
    missingSkills: string[];
    recommendations: string[];
  };
}

STRICT RULES:
- Return ONLY one JSON object. Do not add comments, explanations, markdown, or extra text.
- If no role description is provided, score based on a general resume.
- If a role is provided, tailor scores and recommendations to that role.
- Include roleMatch ONLY if a role description exists.
- Include customSections only if they exist in the input.
- Do not include empty arrays or missing fields.

EXAMPLES (FOR REFERENCE ONLY — DO NOT INCLUDE IN OUTPUT):

# Example 1
{
  "scores": {
    "profile": 8.5,
    "education": 9.0,
    "experience": 8.0,
    "projects": 9.5,
    "skills": 8.8,
    "certifications": 7.0,
    "awards": 6.5,
    "publications": 7.5,
    "overallScore": 8.3
  },
  "customSections": [
    {
      "sectionName": "Volunteering",
      "score": 8.0,
      "remarks": "Strong community involvement, shows leadership."
    }
  ],
  "roleMatch": {
    "targetRole": "Software Engineer",
    "matchPercentage": 85,
    "missingSkills": ["Kubernetes", "CI/CD Pipelines"],
    "recommendations": ["Include DevOps-related work or certifications."]
  }
}

# Example 2
{
  "scores": {
    "profile": 9,
    "education": 8.5,
    "experience": 8,
    "projects": 9.0,
    "skills": 8.5,
    "certifications": 7.5,
    "awards": 6.5,
    "publications": 7,
    "overallScore": 8.3
  }
}

Return ONLY the JSON object.
