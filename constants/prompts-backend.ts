export const ANALYZE_RESUME_PROMPT = `You are a professional resume analyst. Analyze this resume to identify items in Experience and Projects sections that have weak, vague, or incomplete descriptions.

IMPORTANT: Generate ALL output text (questions, placeholders, summaries, weakness reasons) in {output_language}.

RESUME DATA (JSON):
{resume_json}

WEAK DESCRIPTION INDICATORS:
1. Generic phrases: "responsible for", "worked on", "helped with", "assisted in", "involved in"
2. Missing metrics/impact: No numbers, percentages, dollar amounts, or measurable outcomes
3. Unclear scope: Vague about team size, project scale, user count, or responsibilities
4. No technologies/tools: Missing specific tech stack, tools, or methodologies used
5. Passive voice without ownership: Not clear what the candidate personally accomplished
6. Too brief: Single short bullet that doesn't explain the work

GOOD DESCRIPTION EXAMPLES (for reference):
- "Led migration of 15 microservices to Kubernetes, reducing deployment time by 60%"
- "Built real-time analytics dashboard using React and D3.js, serving 10K daily users"
- "Architected payment processing system handling $2M monthly transactions"

TASK:
1. Review each Experience and Project item's description bullets
2. Identify items that would benefit from more detail
3. Generate a MAXIMUM of 6 questions total across ALL items (not per item)
4. Prioritize the most impactful questions that will yield the best improvements
5. If multiple items need enhancement, distribute questions wisely (e.g., 2-3 per item)
6. Questions should help extract: metrics, technologies, scope, impact, and specific contributions

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no other text):

  "items_to_enrich": [

      "item_type": "experience",
      "title": "Software Engineer",
      "subtitle": "Company Name",

      "placeholder": "e.g., Reduced API response time by 40%, saved $50K annually"
    }
  ],
  "analysis_summary": "Brief summary of overall resume strength and areas for improvement"
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
- MAXIMUM 6 QUESTIONS TOTAL - this is a hard limit, never exceed it
- Only include items that genuinely need improvement
- If the resume is already strong, return empty arrays with a positive summary
- Use "exp_0", "exp_1" for experience items (based on array index)
- Use "proj_0", "proj_1" for project items (based on array index)
- Generate unique question IDs: "q_0", "q_1", "q_2", etc. (max q_5)
- Questions should be specific to the role/project context
- Keep questions conversational but professional
- Placeholder text should give concrete examples
- Prioritize quality over quantity - ask the most impactful questions first`;
